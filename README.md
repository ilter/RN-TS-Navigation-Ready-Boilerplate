# React Native Typescript - Navigation v4 Ready - Boilerplate

I figured out that I was losing so many time while installing exact versions of packages, major bundlers such as **react-navigation**. 

That's why I made this repo to save your time while starting from new project on React Native v0.64

## This boilerplate includes:
* React Native v0.64
* TypeScript
* React Navigation v4
* Tab, Stack, Root Navigation and one navigation provider rule them all üòé

## Coming Next:
* Design System
* Redux
* Firebase

## Usage
Pull or Download the Repository.


```
yarn install
cd ios/
npx pod-install
cd ..
npx react-native run-ios || run-android
```

## Troubleshooting

Incase, you want to do it from scracth while referencing the repo. You should check some packages and versions. If you get error because of the packages that listed below, you have to install them one by one.

```
